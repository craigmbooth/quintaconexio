### In Brief

A flat organization is one that has a horizontal, decentralized structure with few or no layers of management between employees and top leadership.  Despite being widely studied, and discussed in the news, there are relatively few examples of flat organizations in reality.

This paper analyzes the conditions for running a successful flat organization and finds that

* Flat structures *can* beat traditional hierarchies when the organizational goal is to become more creative, speedier, or attractive to human talent, but that they are not suitable for all organizations.
* Removing a layer of management necessarily means that more delegation of traditional management tasks will occur, and therefore
* Succeeding with flat corporate structures requires the appropriate organizational design, so that newly autonomous employees are able to effectively take over these tasks.

### Important Definitions

In a discussion of flat and deep organizations, the first term we need to define is *span of control*.  The span of control is the number of subordinates that a supervisor has direct authority over. The span of control is an important consideration in organizational design and management, as it can affect the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization. A narrow span of control, with a small number of subordinates per manager, may allow for more individualized attention and closer supervision, but it may also be more resource-intensive and potentially less efficient. A wider span of control, with a larger number of subordinates per manager, may be more efficient, but it may also result in less individualized attention and supervision.

### Why Are There not More Flat Organizations?

Although there do exist functioning flat organizations, they remain relatively rare.  The author proposes three non-mutually-exclusive reasons this could be because:

* hierarchical structures may not be that bad after all, and they may come in handy when scaling teams-based work becomes difficult.
* it just takes longer for us to witness managerial attempts of moving to flatter structures empirically, because corporations are changing slowly
* managers have already tried to implement flatter structures, but abandoned these endeavors when encountering problems, for example at [Wistia](https://wistia.com/learn/culture/ditching-flat) or [Treehouse](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2016/06/portland_startup_that_eliminat.html)

The thrust of this paper is that the last problem is an important one, and that only certain organizations are suitable for a flat organizational structure.

### When Can Flat Organizations Work?

If we remove layers of management from a company, the span of control of each manager increases, leading to an explosion in their workloads unless they learn to delegate what would traditionally be called "managerial tasks".  The author has previously made the case that managers perform 5 main tasks:

* determine what needs to be done
* determine who does what
* distribute rewards
* provide information
* manage exceptions and disagreements

Managers cannot delegate these duties unless the organization is designed so that the employees are empowered and have access to the information, and be empowered, to perform these tasks.

The big advantage of a flat organizational structure is that it should be expected to inspire more effort from employees, largely through:

* increased alignment with self-determination theory (all people have basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and when these needs are met, they are more likely to experience well-being and personal growth)
* increased self-actualization (the process of fully realizing and expressing one's potential, and becoming the best possible version of oneself.)
* increased perceived control (the extent to which an individual believes they have control over events or outcomes in their environment)
* increased organizational commitment (an individual's identification with, involvement in, and loyalty to their organization.)

Flat structures delegate more decision-making to employees.  Decision-making entails three steps: 1) Gathering information 2)Assessing that information 3)Acting upon that information.

The benefits of flat organizations become visible only when -- across all three phases -- the benefit to cost ratio is superior to a hierarchical organization.

The design of an organization should match what aspects of management work are being delegated.  For example, in a modular system, task division and allocation is a local problem. To foster self-actualization and perceived control, for example, it seems necessary to let people pick their own tasks. To foster attachment, permitting decentralized information exchange would appear sufficient. As such, *design choices must be taken carefully to instill the motivation that managers would like their employees to eventually feel*.

A flat organization can work when the benefits of increased autonomy for workers outweigh the costs of giving up the management layer. Designing an organization to support the workers in whatever aspect of management has been delegated is of critical importance.

### When to Consider a Flat Structure.

There are three main things identified by the author as ideal opportunities for flat organizations:

* Creativity (which benefits from the availability of diverse information to start with, as well as from exposure to heterogeneous viewpoints. Highly interconnected flat structures can thus outperform hierarchies)
* Speed-to-market (when speed hinges on finding scalable, creative solutions to problems, the picture is the same as for creativity)
* Employee retention (autonomy and self determination foster attachment)

A flat organization is not a panacea, but when optimizing towards one of these outcomes, and in a suitably designed way, flat organizations can be a useful tool.
