title: About Quinta Conexio
---

Quinta Conexio ("a connection that is unusual or unexpected"), is the website of [Craig Booth](https://www.craigmbooth.com), and contains summaries of papers that I find interesting, with a few focuses:

* I am curious about the world, so hope and expect this to be wide-ranging, I find it just as enjoyable to think about philosophy, food science and artificial intelligence.
* My audience is myself.  I'm not an expert on much, but I love understanding things.  My goal is that any similar non-expert can read these paper summaries and come away excited.
* One thing I get a kick out of is when I spot a weird connection between two seemingly disparate things.  I hope that over time, as this site grows, we discover a few of those connections.

### What is the Origin of the Name?

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton

Naming things is hard.  In naming any project, you're starting a branding exercise.  A good name is the beginnings of a strong, memorable identity.  It needs to communicate what you're trying to do, who you are, and it also needs to have a good domain name that's still available.

I need a name that adequately communicates that this is where I write about anything that I'm curious about, that we'll be summarizing and reviewing scientific papers, that this isn't a single-topic site, and that on the whole my tendency is to be more whimsical and lighthearted than serious.

Anyway, I am bad at naming things, and since one of the things that have been on my mind recently are advances in AI and large language models, I thought I would take a shot at collaborating with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to get to a better name than I would be able to think of myself.  The following is a conversation with ChatGPT, edited only for style and formatting on this site.

**CRAIG:** "What should I name a blog where I summarize scientific papers that I find interesting?"

**ROBOT:** "There are many different options for names for a blog that summarizes scientific papers. Here are a few ideas:

* Science Summaries
* Research Recap
* Paper Ponderings
* Journal Jargon
* Scientific Synopses
* Lab Lingo
* Academic Abstracts
* Scholarly Summaries

Ultimately, the name you choose will depend on your personal preferences and the tone you want to set for your blog. Consider choosing a name that reflects the content of your blog and that will be easy for your readers to remember."

**CRAIG:** "I'm not a big fan of those, although the alliteration is enjoyable.  I prefer things to be more lighthearted, and let's also try to make single word, whimsical titles for a blog where I summarize scientific papers that are interesting to me. Also, make the titles inspired by latin"

**ROBOT:** "Certainly! Here are some suggestions for single-word, whimsical titles for your blog that might be appropriate for summarizing scientific papers and are derived from Latin:

* Arcanum (meaning "secret" or "mystery")
* Numen (meaning "divine power or spirit")
* Quinta Essentia (meaning "fifth essence")
* Sorceries (meaning "magical practices")
* Elysium (meaning "a place or condition of ideal happiness")
* Glamour (meaning "alluring or fascinating charm")
* Phenomenon (meaning "something extraordinary or inexplicable")
* Mystique (meaning "an aura of mystery or secrecy surrounding something")
* Enigma (meaning "something puzzling or mysterious")
* Mirabilis (meaning "wonderful or marvelous")

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like more ideas."

**CRAIG:** "What does the fifth essence mean?"

**ROBOT:** "The term 'fifth essence' or 'quinta essentia' is derived from ancient philosophy, in which it was believed that there were four elements that made up the physical universe: earth, air, fire, and water. The fifth essence, or quintessence, was believed to be a fifth, intangible element that was the source of all other elements and was responsible for the movement of the celestial bodies. In this sense, the fifth essence was thought to be the source of all life and the driving force behind the natural world.

In modern usage, the term 'fifth essence' or 'quintessence' can be used metaphorically to refer to the pure, highly concentrated essence of something, or to the most perfect or typical example of a quality or class."

**CRAIG:** "I kinda like it, but it feels a bit high minded for me.  Let's try something close, what is 'the fifth connection' in Latin?"

**ROBOT:** "In Latin, 'the fifth connection' could be translated as 'quinta conexio'. 'Conexio' is the Latin word for 'connection,' and 'quinta' means 'fifth.' Together, these words suggest a connection that is the fifth in a series of connections.

Please note that this phrase is not a commonly used term in Latin, and its exact meaning would depend on the context in which it is used. It could be used to refer to a specific connection that is the fifth in a series of connections, or *it could be used metaphorically to suggest a connection that is unusual or unexpected*."

**CRAIG:** "Thanks!"
